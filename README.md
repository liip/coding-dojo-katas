Coding Dojo Katas
=

This is a collection of katas meant to be used to practice certain coding abilities. 

There will be both katas with existing code meant for refactoring or analysis as well as katas where you have to start from scratch with a set of existing tests. Every kata will have a short introduction on what the script is or should be doing.

Feel free to use those katas as they are or modify them for your own coding dojos or similar at will.
