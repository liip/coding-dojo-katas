Simple To-Do list application
=

## Initial situation ##

This is a simple To-Do List application that allows the user to add, remove and tick items on a list.

The `ToDo.List` object provides four methods, to `add`, `remove`, `check` and `uncheck` objects of `ToDo.Item`, which in turn only has a few attributes to identify the item.

The code for the whole todo list, as well as tests for all methods are given, but the code is far from optimal.

## Purpose ##

The code in this kata is already implemented and has some code smells as well as some bugs. It can therefore be used to practice understanding of code of others as well as refactoring and detection of bugs and unwanted behaviour.
